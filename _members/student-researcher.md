We are excited to offer experimental research opportunities for undergraduate students, particularly those with strong analytical skills from disciplines like physics, math, engineering, and computer science. Selected undergraduates will be paired with a PhD student and/or postdoc mentor, and receive hands-on training in our cutting-edge research projects, and personalized guidance towards achieving their career aspirations. We are keen to welcome students from all backgrounds, including those new to research. If you are interested in joining our team, please contact Jared Cregg with your CV and a brief statement of interest (under 200 words).
