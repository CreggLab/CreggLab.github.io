I recently launched my independent research program as an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Neuroscience and Neurology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. My research is driven by a curiosity for how the nervous system orchestrates motor actions, focusing on decoding the functional organization of brainstem motor circuits. The aim is to map out the brainstem’s role in motor execution toward innovative treatments for movement disorders. This work has been recognized through awards including the Goldwater Scholarship and fellowships from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), and the Lundbeck Foundation.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Michigan Technological University. In 2018, I earned my PhD in Neuroscience from Case Western Reserve University under the mentorship of Drs. Jerry Silver and Lynn T. Landmesser. My PhD thesis used functional and molecular lenses to investigate the neural control of respiration. I then went on to do a postdoc with Prof. Ole Kiehn at the University of Copenhagen, where I further expanded my expertise in dissecting brainstem motor circuits to incorporate behavioral studies.

Outside the laboratory, I find joy and balance in music and nature. As an amateur violinist, I love to draw connections between music and motor precision. Cross-country skiing offers a tranquil retreat into nature, with its rhythmic motions mirroring the coordination of movement central to my research.
