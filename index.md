# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-brain" %}AT THE INTERSECTION OF NEUROSCIENCE & NEUROLOGY

The Cregg Lab will open July 1st, 2024 in the Departments of Neuroscience & Neurology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In the Cregg Lab, we will focus on understanding brainstem circuits and their critical role in motor control. Our team will employ cutting-edge techniques to dissect brainstem motor circuits in sophisticated anatomical, molecular, and functional detail. Our work will aim to enhance our comprehension of the neural circuitry controlling movement, and offer insights into movement disorders such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

## Highlights

The brainstem connects higher brain functions to the spinal cord for movement execution. Our research aims to understand how brainstem motor circuits are organized.  This knowledge could lead to new treatments for movement disorders in humans.
